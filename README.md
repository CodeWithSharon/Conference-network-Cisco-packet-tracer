A conference network is a specialized network designed to support various devices and services during a conference or large-scale event. This network typically facilitates seamless communication, data sharing, internet access, and device management for attendees, presenters, and organizers. The conference network must be highly reliable, secure, and capable of handling a large volume of concurrent devices and services, such as laptops, smartphones, printers, etc. 

 

Purpose: To provide seamless communication, internet access, and efficient traffic management during a conference or large-scale event. 

 

 

Key Components: 

1. Edge Router (With SSL VPN) 

Functionality: 

Manages internet connectivity for the conference network. 

Configures SSL VPN to provide secure remote access to conference resources. 

Implements firewall rules to ensure network security. 

2. Core Switch (MULTILAYER SWITCH) 

Functionality: 

Distributes traffic across different VLANs or subnets. 

Connects edge routers, distribution switches, and access points. 

Ensures high-speed data transfer between different network segments. 

3. Distribution Switches 

Functionality: 

Manages traffic flow between core and access switches. 

Implements VLANs for different conference areas (e.g., speaker sessions, attendees). 

Supports Quality of Service (QoS) for prioritizing VoIP, video streaming, and data traffic. 

4. Access Switches 

Functionality: 

Connects end-user devices such as laptops, desktops, and conference kiosks. 

Provides Power over Ethernet (PoE) for VoIP phones and access points. 

Enforces network access control (NAC) for security. 

5. Wireless Access Points (APs) 

Functionality: 

Provides Wi-Fi connectivity for attendees, organizers, and speakers. 

Implements  security for encrypted communications. 

6. Conference Servers 

Functionality: 

Hosts web applications, event schedules, and registration systems. 

Manages live streaming and video conferencing platforms . 

Provides file-sharing services for documents, presentations, and recordings. 

7. VoIP Phones  

Functionality: 

Handles internal and external voice communication using VoIP. 

Connects conference rooms, reception, and organizer offices. 

8. Firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) 

Functionality: 

Protects against unauthorized access and cyber threats. 

Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity. 

Implements Access Control Lists (ACLs) and VPN security policies. 

9. Storage & Backup Servers 

Functionality: 

Stores recorded sessions, documents, and conference data. 

Provides redundancy and disaster recovery solutions. 

Supports cloud synchronization for remote access. 

10. End-User Devices 

Functionality: 

Includes laptops, tablets, smartphones. 

Connects via wired or wireless network. 

Accesses conference materials, live streams, and communication tools. 

 

           11.SSL VPN in a Conference Network 

SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows remote users to securely access internal conference network resources over the internet using a web browser. It encrypts data using SSL/TLS, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. 

 

->ALSO, NEED TO ACTIVATE ALL THE DEVICES TO DHCP FOR PACKETS TO BE SENT ACROSS THE NETWORK.
